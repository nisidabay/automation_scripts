## Introduction

This repository is a personal collection of scripts primarily designed to be a
hands-on learning tool for reinforcing my skills across multiple programming
languages. It also serves to automate daily tasks on my ArchLinux distro.

## Motivation

As I'm fond of working with different languages, I often find myself
deep-diving into one and forgetting the syntax and best practices of others.
This repository is my solution to that challenge. By creating parallel scripts
for common tasks in Bash, Lua, Python, Ruby, and Go, I aim to maintain and
strengthen my proficiency in each language through practical application and
comparative analysis.

## Repository Structure

Scripts are organized by the task or concept they address. This structure helps
in finding the right tool for the job and makes it easy to compare how
different languages approach the same problem.

### Task/Concept Names

*   `/network_tools`: Top-level directory for tasks related to network
operations.
*   `/language_name/`: Sub-directory within each task folder to hold the
scripts written in that specific language.
*   `/system_maintenance`: Top-level directory for tasks related to system
maintenance.
*   `/language_name/`: Sub-directory within each task folder to hold the
scripts written in that specific language.
* And so on ...

### Directory Layout

```markdown

└── /system_maintenance
    ├── /bash
    │   └── clear_cache.sh
    └── /lua
        └── log_cleanup.lua
```

## Languages Used

### Language Purpose in this Repository

*   **Bash**: Quick, no-nonsense shell scripting for core system tasks.
*   **Go**: Disciplined and efficient code for tasks requiring performance.
*   **Lua**: Lightweight and elegant scripting for simple, focused tasks.
*   **Python**: Readable and pragmatic scripts, often used for more complex logic.
*   **Ruby**: Expressive and concise code for tasks where developer happiness
is a priority.

## Conclusion

This is a personal project. The goal is to always be learning and to keep the
"muscle memory" of each language sharp!!
